# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using classification models and feature engineering.

---

## 📌 Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic Kaggle competition dataset. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and family size.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- Files:
  - `train.csv` – Training data
  - `test.csv` – Test data for predictions

## 🔍 Steps in the Project
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Feature Engineering
4. Encoding Categorical Variables
5. Model Building (Random Forest Classifier)
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
7. Prediction on Test Data
8. Kaggle Submission
